# Insurance Data Analysis

In this project I intend to show how to use a few Machine Learning Algorithms(Linear Regression, Random Forest)
to predict the charges an individual would cost an insurance company

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine 
for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

- Windows 7/8/10:
    - Intellij IDEA
    - Scala version <= 2.11.x
    - Apache Spark version 2.x.x
    - sbt version 1.x.x  
    

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

- Download:
    - [Intellij IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)
    - [sbt](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)
    - [Spark](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/): 
           - After downloading Apache Spark, follow the instructions from 
                [here](https://hernandezpaul.wordpress.com/2016/01/24/apache-spark-installation-on-windows-10/)
           - Make sure to check that your installation works by running the command --> 
           **_spark-shell_** in your native command line
